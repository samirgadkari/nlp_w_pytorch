Corpus (plural Corpora): Raw text + metadata related to text.
Tokens: For english, whitespace delimited character groups.
Types: Unique tokens present in a corpus

It is very important to get the right level of tokens to process.
For example the "-ol" in Methanol implies that it is an alcohol.
If you want your neural network to use this information, you
should maybe break the word into Methan and ol?

Lemmas as root forms of the word. ex. fly is a lemma for
flying, flies, flew, flown, etc. To keep dimensionality of the
vector representation low, you should lemmatize your tokens.

```{python}
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

doc = nlp(u"he was running late")
for token in doc:
  print("{} ---> {}".format(token, token.lemma_))

# For some reason, we need a blank line after a line that is
# indented (ex. print line above).
```
